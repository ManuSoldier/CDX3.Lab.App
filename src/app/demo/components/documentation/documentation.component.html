            <h5>Current Version</h5>
            <p>Angular 14 and PrimeNG 14</p>

            <h5>Dependencies</h5>
            <p>Ultima has no direct dependency. More information about dependencies is available at <a href="https://www.primefaces.org/why-primeng-templates/">Why PrimeNG Templates</a> article.</p>

            <h5>Getting Started</h5>
            <p>Ultima is a true native application template for Angular and is distributed as a CLI project. In case CLI is not installed already, use the command below to set it up.</p>
<pre class="app-code"><code>npm install -g @angular-cli</code></pre>

            <p>Once CLI is ready in your system, extract the contents of the Ultima zip file distribution, cd to the directory,
            install the libraries from npm and then execute "ng serve" to run the application in your local environment at http://localhost:4200/.</p>

<pre class="app-code"><code>cd ultima
npm install
ng serve</code></pre>

            <p>That's it, you may now start with the development of your application.</p>

            <h5>Important CLI Commands</h5>
            <p>Following commands are derived from CLI.</p>
<pre class="app-code"><code>Run 'ng serve' for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run 'ng generate component component-name' to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class/module`.

Run 'ng build' to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

Run 'ng test' to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run 'ng e2e' to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

Run 'ng help' for more options.</code></pre>
